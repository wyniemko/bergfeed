                <p>Look, we've all been there. You're scrolling through Netflix at 2 AM, and suddenly you're watching "The Waterboy" for the 47th time, thinking "this would make an incredible video game." Well, I'm here to tell you that Adam Sandler is sitting on a goldmine of untapped gaming potential.</p>

                <p><strong>Happy Gilmore Golf Simulator</strong><br>
                Forget Tiger Woods PGA Tour. We need a golf game where you can hockey-slap drives 400 yards while Bob Barker provides commentary. Imagine the rage mechanics when you miss a putt – your character literally fights the other golfers. The final boss? Shooter McGavin in a winner-takes-all tournament.</p>

                <p><strong>Billy Madison's School Escape</strong><br>
                A stealth-action game where you play as Billy trying to pass each grade without getting caught being a 27-year-old man-child. Dodge dodgeball bullies, sneak past teachers, and collect chocolate milk power-ups. The penguin hallucination sequences would be absolutely wild in VR.</p>

                <p><strong>The Waterboy: Hydration Station</strong><br>
                Part sports management sim, part tower defense. You're Bobby Boucher managing water supplies for multiple teams while defending against dehydration enemies. Special moves include the "Mama Says" wisdom boost and the legendary tackle that sends opponents flying into the stratosphere.</p>

                <p><strong>Big Daddy: Parenting Simulator</strong><br>
                Think The Sims meets Octodad. You're trying to raise a kid while having absolutely no idea what you're doing. Mini-games include "Convince the Social Worker You're Competent" and "McDonald's Breakfast Run at 3 PM." The emotional growth system would be surprisingly deep.</p>

                <p>The beauty of Sandler games isn't just the comedy – it's the heart. Every Adam Sandler movie, no matter how ridiculous, has genuine emotional moments. These games would be the perfect blend of absurd humor and unexpected feels.</p>

                <p>Plus, imagine the DLC possibilities. "Wedding Singer: Beat Matching Madness." "50 First Dates: Memory Palace Builder." "Uncut Gems: Anxiety Simulator" (okay, maybe that last one is too intense).</p>

                <p>Hollywood, if you're reading this, my DMs are open. Let's make this happen.</p>
